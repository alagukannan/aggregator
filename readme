Basic Requirements:
	Coldfusion 9.0.1
	Coldbox 3.00
	Microsoft SQL Server. In case of Mysql remove the unique key constraints in the blogs and blogEntries model since its throwing an error when hibernate creates the constraints.
	ORM Enabled coldbox 3.00 application.
	SES Interceptor enabled.

Installation Instruction:
Grab the Aggregator Module and place it in the Modules Directory.
Enable ORM with data source and set the cfc locations.
 e.g:
 	<cfscript>
		this.datasource = 'datasource name';
		this.ormEnabled = true;
		this.ormSettings	  = {
			cfclocation	= "modules/aggregator/model", // orm model location
			dbcreate 	= "update",
			flushatrequestend = false
		};
	</cfscript>	
Enable coldbox event and handler caching settings.
Enable SES interceptor if not enabled since this app requires SES enabled.
Add the following Module route to the routes.cfm file:
	addModuleRoutes(pattern="/aggregator",module="aggregator");
Configure Logbox in your coldbox config if you need to log info logged by the module.
Secure the Admin module handler (aggregator:admin.*) using your security interceptor.
URLs if App is running in root.
Admin URL: http://localhost/aggregator/admin
Aggregator Home page: http://localhost/aggregator/
